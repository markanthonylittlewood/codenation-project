            1.1 - IT is essential to Modern business due to the reliance upon digital technology. From Finance, customer records and communications, they all rely on an IT infrastructure.     
        <br>
        <br>1.2 - In order to effectively work on a project a number of tools are essential. Firstly, if you are working as part of a team you need to collaborate and communicate. Slack is an ideal tool for this as it allows you to set up individual channels to communicate through. You can also share documents through Slack. 
            A decent IDE is also required, I prefer to use VS Code as this allows me the freedom to use the right tools for the job via the extensions.
        <br>
        <br>1.3 - Firstly, to build a website you need to decide on what the website is about. When you know this, you can put together a basic structure of content. This can be done by way of planning the individual pages and the mapping of the website structure, menus etc.
        I would use Trello to set specific tasks for each page so that you can map your progress and assign individual tasks per page. This is essential as some pages me require individual tasks…images etc.
        In relation to the code required. HTML & CSS can be used to build the website structure. Ig you want to incorporate some-kind of database functionality I would use PHP.
        <br>
        <br>1.4 - The main risk in my opinion is if you are working collaboratively with a team of developers and you all work on code differently. It may become difficult to reconcile the code as one if it is structured differently by each developer. Another concern is the advancement of technology. Technology is a fast moving area and technologies and frameworks that are cutting edge one minute can become obsolete.
        <br>
        <br>1.5 -To pick the correct and most suitable software for a project you will first need to ascertain what service or function the website needs to provide. For example, if a database is required then you will need to utilises a programming language for this function, such as php.
        <br>
        <br>1.6 - In terms of how my chosen technologies have assisted me. Trello was invaluable as it allowed me to plan and assess my progress. I was able to use Trello to allocate tasks to myself.
        VS Code was the IDE that I used, and that I will continue to use throughout my software development journey. The extensions on VS code made the writing code aspect of the software development process seamless and intuiative.
        <br>
        <br>1.7 - In relation to legal guidelines, the only implication here is compliance with GDPR. If I am to contact people via my website then I will need to obtain their permission in accordance with the GDPR protocol.
        To comply I would include as part of my declaration in the page footer a section dedicated to GDPR and also

        <br>2.1 & 2.2 - Whilst planning and building my website I utilised the VS Code IDE. This was a great tool to use as it allowed me to code efficiently. Trello was also a great resource as it allowed me to plan my progress and visualise how I was getting on.
        I used Adobe Photoshop to edit some of the images so they fit the scheme I was looking for.
        <br>
        <br>2.3 - Overall, I am quite happy with the website. It looks aesthetically good and makes good use of colours and contras to give a modern feel to the site.
        In relation to changes, I would like to add more functionality to the website using Javascript.
        <br>
        <br>2.4- The website should showcase our abilities to develop and build using html & css. I think that the website displays this. It also shows advanced uses of html such as downloading documents.
        <br>
        <br>3.1 - The tools used to build the website were effective in helping me plan and develop. This task could have been undertaken by a team, although, in my experience this could create a problem as the site will need to be consistent in both look and content.
        <br>
        <br>3.2 - Greater use of Trello would make the process more efficient. I could have also broken down the process into bite-size chunks (truncation). This would allow me to concentrate on a particular element.
        <br>
        <br>3.3 - If working as part of a team the use of slack would help collaboration between team members. Slack allows you to communicate via a channel and also share documents. It can also be linked to Trello.
        <br>
        <br>3.4 - Testing is an important step in the development process. To test each part, I made additions and amendments to the code and utilised the ‘live server’ extension in VS Code. This allowed me to see my amendments in real-time.
